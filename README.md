# Jasmine: TokenStream-based Parser

Pest was so annoying to use so I just did a `"my_code".parse::<TokenStream>()`
and parsed it that way. It's basically a proc-macro without the macro part.

## Where are things

- Parser: `parser/`
- Data structures: `libjasmine/`
- Runnable binary: `src/main.rs`

## Goofy Jasmine Stuff

- Prefix types with `__ext_java_` to use java builtins

## What is this

Read `README.md` on the main branch.
