# The Jasmine Programming Language

Java sucks ass. Let's make it better.

This language (will) transpile into java (when I have finished it). It currently has rust-like syntax with some features removed (i.e. traits).

Why did I do this? My CS class forces me to use java soooooo.....

Currently, the rust code in this repo will parse the source code into an AST.
